low,"Define a test method annotated with `@Test` that validates the behavior of the static method `loadResourceProperties` on the `FTPClient` class by invoking it with various path arguments and asserting the expected return values. Begin by invoking `FTPClient.loadResourceProperties(null)` and immediately assert that the result is null using `assertNull`. Next, invoke `FTPClient.loadResourceProperties(""this/does/not/exist.properties"")` and assert that the returned value is null with `assertNull`. Then invoke `FTPClient.loadResourceProperties(""/this/does/not/exist.properties"")` and assert null using `assertNull`. Following this, invoke `FTPClient.loadResourceProperties(FTPClient.SYSTEM_TYPE_PROPERTIES)` where `SYSTEM_TYPE_PROPERTIES` is a public static final String field on `FTPClient`, and assert that the result is null using `assertNull`. After these null assertions, invoke `FTPClient.loadResourceProperties("""")` with an empty string literal and assert that the returned value is not null using `assertNotNull`. Subsequently, invoke `FTPClient.loadResourceProperties(""/org/apache/commons/net/examples/examples.properties"")` and assert that the result is not null with `assertNotNull`. Finally, invoke `FTPClient.loadResourceProperties(""/org/apache/commons/net/test.properties"")` and assert that the returned value is not null using `assertNotNull`. The test uses JUnit 4 assertions (`assertNull` and `assertNotNull`) and is annotated with `@Test` at the method level, with no class-level annotations, no setup or teardown methods, and no mocking libraries.",375,False,testLoadResourceProperties(),commons-net,org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTPClientTest
high,"Create a test case to validate that the object pool system correctly applies and reflects the detailed statistics collection preference when configured during pool construction. Begin by preparing a configuration that explicitly disables the detailed statistics collection feature, then construct a new object pool instance using this configuration along with the standard resource factory. Verify that the newly created pool respects the configuration by confirming the detailed statistics collection feature remains disabled as specified. Additionally, ensure the configuration's text representation includes a clear indication of the detailed statistics collection setting to support operational transparency. After validating both the pool's behavior and the configuration's visibility, release the pool resources. This test uses JUnit 5 for execution and AssertJ-style assertions to verify both the pool's adherence to the configuration setting and the presence of the configuration property in the text output.",469,False,testDetailedStatisticsConfigIntegration(),commons-pool,org.apache.commons.pool3.impl.TestBaseGenericObjectPool
medium,"Define a test method that validates the insert operation behavior of the Text String Builder component across multiple data types and boundary conditions by instantiating a new Text String Builder, then verify the initial state produces an empty string representation, after which insert a string literal at position zero and confirm the resulting content matches the inserted value, followed by asserting that attempts to insert at negative indices or positions beyond the current length trigger index out of bounds errors, then proceed to insert a boolean value at the current end position and validate the updated string representation reflects the appended boolean text, again verifying that insertions at invalid positions beyond the new length or negative offsets produce boundary exceptions, next insert a character at the terminal position and confirm the character is appended correctly while ensuring invalid index insertions fail appropriately, then insert a character array at the end position and verify the array contents are incorporated into the builder's string representation with subsequent validation that array insertions at positions exceeding the current size or negative indices raise exceptions, after which insert a subset of a character array using offset and length parameters at the terminal position and confirm only the specified portion is inserted while verifying that invalid positioning for partial array insertions triggers appropriate errors, continue by inserting a double value at the end and validating its string representation appears in the builder while confirming boundary violations for double insertions are detected, then insert a float value at the terminal position and verify its conversion to string format is correctly appended with corresponding boundary checks, proceed to insert an integer at the end position and confirm the numeric string representation is incorporated while ensuring invalid index attempts fail, insert a long value at the terminal position and validate its string conversion appears correctly with appropriate exception handling for boundary violations, and finally insert an object reference at the end position and verify the object's string representation is appended to the builder while confirming that insertions beyond valid indices or at negative positions produce index out of bounds errors, using JUnit 5 for test execution and assertions.",1090,False,testInsertAtEnd(),commons-text,org.apache.commons.text.TextStringBuilderAppendInsertTest
medium,"Define a test class that verifies the absence of circular dependency issues during static initialization between the Generic Validator and Credit Card Validator components. Within the test method, instantiate a Credit Card Validator to trigger its static initialization sequence, which internally references validation constants and code validators for various card types including American Express, Visa, Mastercard, Discover, Diners, and VPay. Following the instantiation, invoke the credit card validation method on the Generic Validator with a numeric string input to confirm that the method executes without encountering a null pointer exception that would indicate a circular dependency in the static initialization chain between the two validator classes. Assert that the validation call completes successfully, demonstrating that the Generic Validator can access the Credit Card Validator's static members after the Credit Card Validator instance has been created without triggering initialization order conflicts. This test addresses a defect where the Generic Validator's static reference to Credit Card Validator functionality would fail if invoked before explicit instantiation of a Credit Card Validator instance due to incomplete static initialization.

medium,"Define a test method that verifies IPv6 URL resolution within an FTP file system context, beginning by establishing a File System Manager through inherited setup that creates a temporary directory, cleans it, initializes a Default File System Manager with a files cache and file replicator wrapped in privileged access, registers an SMB file provider, conditionally adds a default local file provider if absent, initializes the manager, and resolves base test folders including read and write directories while validating the read folder exists and is not the root path. Within the test method, declare an IPv6 FTP URL string containing a link-local address with interface scope and file path, then invoke the manager's resolve file method with this URL and a new file system options instance to obtain an FTP File Object. Upon retrieval, validate that the file object's underlying file system returns the expected root URI matching the IPv6 address portion of the original URL by calling get file system followed by get root URI and asserting equality with the expected root string. Additionally, verify that the file object's relative path property returns the expected file name by invoking get relative path and asserting equality with the file name extracted from the URL. After test completion, execute teardown that closes the read folder, write folder, and base folder file objects if present, triggers garbage collection multiple times with intervening thread sleeps to allow soft reference cleanup, instructs the manager to free unused resources, closes the manager, allows a brief delay for thread termination, validates the temporary directory is empty or removed through a helper that checks directory existence and emptiness, and finally closes the VFS singleton. The test relies on JUnit for test execution and standard assertion methods for validation.",803,False,testResolveIPv6Url(),commons-vfs,org.apache.commons.vfs2.provider.ftp.FtpProviderIPv6Test
