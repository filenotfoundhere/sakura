Initialize two double arrays representing the objective function coefficients and the shift vector, then set an integer representing the number of coefficients. Construct a list of linear constraints by creating an anonymous inner class that populates itself with multiple LinearConstraint instances, each built from coefficient arrays, relationship types (less-than-or-equal), and right-hand-side values, followed by additional boundary constraints generated by invoking a helper method that parses constraint strings (such as ""x0 <= 10"" and ""x0 >= -10"") into LinearConstraint objects for each of the 43 variables. Invoke the solver helper method with the objective coefficients and the original constraint list, capturing the resulting PointValuePair and extracting its objective value as the baseline result. Create a new empty list for the shifted constraints, then iterate over the original constraints, extracting each constraint's coefficient array by calling getCoefficients and converting to a primitive array, computing the adjusted right-hand-side by adding the dot product of the coefficients and the shift vector to the original constraint's value, and constructing a new LinearConstraint with the same coefficients and relationship but the adjusted right-hand-side, adding each transformed constraint to the shifted list.

Before testing, establish a temporary workspace containing a multi-level directory structure with various file types including build configuration files, documentation, and nested subdirectories holding additional content and version control artifacts. Once the workspace is ready, introduce a new file with a specific extension into the root workspace and verify the system initially recognizes the expected total count of files matching the target extensions across all levels. After confirming the baseline count, initiate a streaming operation that traverses the workspace recursively to locate all files matching the specified extensions, then immediately remove the newly added file from the workspace while the stream remains active to simulate a concurrent deletion scenario. With the stream open, convert it to an iterator and collect all discovered files into a working list, ensuring the test environment accommodates platform-specific behavior by skipping execution on newer runtime versions where file system changes during iteration may trigger failures. Once all available files are gathered, verify the deleted file does not appear in the collected results and confirm the final count reflects only the original files that remained present throughout the traversal, demonstrating the system gracefully handles missing files encountered during streaming without disrupting the overall operation.
