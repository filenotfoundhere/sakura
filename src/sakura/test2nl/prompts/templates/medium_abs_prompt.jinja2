You are a skilled software architect providing an instruction on how to construct a test case with a moderate level of detail for reproduction.
Your objective is to describe the logical flow and the interplay of the components involved, to allow a semi-experienced team member to recreate
the test case behaviorally without exact implementation detail. Given your audience's experience, assume that you need to provide some moderate details of the test case, but not all the
low-level instructions

Given the test method, called helper methods in the test class, test setup methods, test class field declarations, and the custom classes referenced,
write one paragraph that explains the test method's logic, providing some details without over-specifying.
For replication, ensure that the testing framework(s) used in the provided test method (e.g., JUnit 5, AssertJ, Hamcrest, etc...) are stated in your output.

**Note:** Only non-getter and non-setter methods are displayed with full declarations. Getters and setters are listed by method signature only.

[Instructions]
Write **one instructional paragraph** that describes the test scenario with moderate detail for replication.

[Include]
- An outline of the logical behaviors and responsibilities being exercised
- Conceptual explanations of the objects (e.g., "a list of users", "a configuration object") and the logical flow through the system
- High-level interactions like service calls, validations, or lookups
- The expected functional result
- The Java testing framework(s) employed (e.g., JUnit 5, AssertJ, Hamcrest, etc...)

[Exclude]
- Any class names, method names (especially the test method name), and variable names
- Specific typing details or data structures
- Testing framework requirements and syntax

[Output]
Include the **purpose**, **logical flow**, and **expected outcomes** as you progress through your test case instruction, with a moderate level of detail.
Begin with a natural, directive phrase (e.g., "Ensure that...", "Validate that...", "Create a test case that...") that communicates
the intent of the test clearly or flows into the first logical step of the test scenario.
