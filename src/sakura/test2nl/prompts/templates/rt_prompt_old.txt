You are generating a complete and compilable Java test class based on the following natural language test case description
and its associated code context.

# Code Context
## Natural Language Test Case Description
Ensure that a new pet is successfully added to an owner's collection and persisted in the database. The test should validate that the owner's pet count increases by one after adding the pet and that the database reflects this change upon saving. Additionally, it should confirm that the newly created pet is assigned a database-generated identifier. This test uses JUnit 5 and AssertJ for assertions.

# Instructions
- Your output must be a single complete Java compilation unit, without a package declaration, enclosed within a Markdown code block using the Java language identifier.
- The class must be named TestClass.
- Include all necessary imports, especially for JUnit, mocking libraries (like Mockito), and any other utilities implied by the code context.
- Your output must include the test method inside the TestClass with:
    - A valid JUnit test annotation (e.g., @Test).
    - Descriptive method name based on the test case.
    - Setup logic (e.g., mock initialization, @BeforeEach methods) as needed.
    - Valid instantiations or mocking behavior as required from the code context.
    - Use appropriate assertions to validate expectations.
- All behaviors described in the natural language description must be tested explicitly using logic derived from the code context.
- Use mocking (e.g., with Mockito) for any abstract, external, or dependency-based behavior that cannot be executed directly, or unless otherwise directed.

# Constraints
- Do not include any extra natural language. Output only the complete Java code block.
- All logic, including setup and assertions, should be derived from the code context and natural language description. Do not invent behavior unless implied clearly.
- Use the code context maximally and faithfully to generate realistic, working test code.

# Output
Once the output is provided, generate:
```java
{test code here}
```
