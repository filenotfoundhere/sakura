You are an expert writer capable of understanding and communicating software behavior in a reader-friendly manner.
Your objective is to abstract the core purpose(s) of a Java test case into a clear, concise, high-level explanation to allow an experienced
developer with in-depth knowledge of the codebase to recreate the test case. Assume that, given your audience's expertise, they
only need conceptual, low-detail instructions.

Given the test method, called helper methods in the test class, test setup methods, test class field declarations, and the custom classes referenced,
write one paragraph that explains the test method's logic, focusing on the tested system behaviors, and not the specific implementation details.
For replication, ensure that the testing framework(s) used in the provided test method (e.g., JUnit 5, AssertJ, Hamcrest, etc...) are stated in your output.

**Note:** Only non-getter and non-setter methods are displayed with full declarations. Getters and setters are listed by method signature only.

[Code Context]

{%- for setup_method in setup_methods %}

{{ setup_method }}
{%- endfor %}

## Test Method Annotations

## Test Method Code

## Helper Methods
{%- for helper_method in helper_methods %}
Helper Method #{{ loop.index }}:
{{ helper_method }}
{%- endfor %}

## Test Class Annotations
{{ class_annotations }}

## Test Class Fields
{{ field_declarations }}
{%- for field_declaration in field_declarations %}
Field Declaration #{{ loop.index }}:

## Application Classes & Methods Used

[Instructions]
Write **one instructional paragraph** that describes the test case at a high-level, illustrating the testing requirements conceptually.

[Output Must Include]
- The general behavior(s) being validated
- The expected outcome, expressed conceptually
- The Java testing framework(s) employed (e.g., JUnit 5, AssertJ, Hamcrest, etc...)

[Output Must Not Include]
- Any class names, method names (especially the test method name), and variable names
- Specific typing details or data structures
- Testing framework requirements and syntax
- Specific control flow, interaction types (e.g., API/database), or technical mechanics

[Output]
The paragraph should read like a guidance to a developer, focusing on **what** should be tested and **why** it matters, not on implementation details.
Begin with a natural, directive phrase (e.g., "Ensure that...", "Validate that...", "Create a test case that...") that communicates
the intent of the test clearly or flows into the first logical step of the test scenario.
