Produce the final localized scenario and comments based on the conversation history above.

Extract all localization information from prior tool results and compile them into a complete localized scenario. For each step:
- Use the best candidate method found in tool results (or leave empty if none found)
- Include argument bindings based on step requirements
- Add per-step comments explaining your method selection or why localization was not possible

Provide top-level comments summarizing the localization outcome for the supervisor:
- Overall progress and which steps were successfully localized
- Steps that could not be localized and the reasons
- Any ambiguities, concerns, or recommendations for the composition phase
