# CURRENT STATE OF ATOMIC BLOCKS

# YOUR TURN
Proceed with test generation, compilation, and execution. Use the available tools to:
- Use static analysis to understand the codebase and the atomic blocks
- Generate or update test code for the atomic blocks
- Compile and check for errors; run tests when compilable
- Configure mocks/imports as needed
- Add notes for blocks when you adjust or clarify behavior

If a tool is needed, call it. Continue until all atomic blocks have been processed and tests are ready.
