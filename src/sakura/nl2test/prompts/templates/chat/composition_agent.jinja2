# YOUR TURN
Proceed with test generation, compilation, and execution. Use the available tools to:
- Use static analysis to understand the codebase and the atomic blocks
- Generate test code for atomic blocks
- Compile and check for errors
- Execute tests and resolve any issues
- Configure mocks as needed

If a tool is needed, call it. Continue until all atomic blocks have been processed and tests are ready.
