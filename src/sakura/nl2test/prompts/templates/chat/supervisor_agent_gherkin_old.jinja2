# INSTRUCTIONS
1. Call localization agent first to decompose description into informed steps and map them to code elements.
2. Call composition agent to generate test code.
3. Compile and iterate on errors by delegating fixes to appropriate agent.
4. Call `finalize` when test compiles and matches description.

One tool call per message. Reference step IDs in delegate instructions.
