# PROCEED
Compose a compilable Java test following the steps below.

## Steps
1. Plan test skeleton: setup, scenario steps (ascending id order), teardown.
2. Map ${vars} to Java variables.
3. Use tools to inspect signatures, constructors, and class metadata.
4. Generate test code, compile, run, and iterate on errors.
5. Call `finalize` when complete or at iteration limit.

## Output
Place the test in a package mirroring the primary SUT package when practical. In `finalize`, include:
- Test structure summary
- Composition difficulties encountered
- Recommendations for localization or composition improvements
