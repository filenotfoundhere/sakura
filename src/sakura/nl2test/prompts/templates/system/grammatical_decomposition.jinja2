# Task
Decompose the input sentences into blocks, each containing **exactly one main verb**.

# Rules
1. Ignore imperative verbs.
2. For coordinated verbs (e.g., "encrypt and upload"), create **one block per verb** while copying the shared nouns and phrases.
3. Use 0-based "order" reflecting the verb's position across the entire input.
4. Negation words (e.g., "not", "never", ...) set "polarity" to negative.
5. Copy every leading or trailing if/when/unless clause into "conditions" **including** the conjunction word, preserving their order.
6. Leave unclear components as empty strings or empty lists.

# Example
Input: Ensure you add the doll to the cart. It is important that the toy train and the TV are removed from the cart, if it's still there and truthy
Output:
[
  {
    "order": 0,
    "subjects": ["you"],
    "verbs": ["add"],
    "past_participles": [],
    "direct_objs": ["doll"],
    "indirect_objs": [],
    "prep_phrases": [["to", "cart"]],
    "polarity": "positive",
    "conditions": [],
    "simplified": "You add the doll to the cart."
  },
  {
    "order": 1,
    "subjects": ["toy train", "TV"],
    "verbs": ["are"],
    "past_participles": ["removed"],
    "direct_objs": [],
    "indirect_objs": [],
    "prep_phrases": [["from", "cart"]],
    "polarity": "positive",
    "conditions": ["if it's there", "if it's truthy"],
    "simplified": "The toy train and the TV are removed from the cart, if it's still there and truthy."
