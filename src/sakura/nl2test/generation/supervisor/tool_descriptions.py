CALL_LOCALIZATION_AGENT_GHERKIN_DESC_OLD='\nDelegate to the localization agent to begin localization or refine an already localized scenario.\nArgs:\n  instructions: Concrete, strict, and explicit guidance describing which steps to adjust and what to inspect. If modifications are to certain steps only, list the steps by `id` and explicitly mention to not make other changes. You can be more high-level when asking for localization for all steps, like on the first tool call.\nNotes:\n  The Supervisor automatically injects the current LocalizedScenario from its own state; you must not supply `blocks`.\nUse when:\n  You need 1 to 3 candidate methods per step (best-first), updated argument bindings, re-scoring or replacement of candidates, step split/merge, or improved notes and provenance for Gherkin-style steps.\n  This should be used to first localize the steps to any relevant methods, and also to make any localization changes based on execution feedback as iterations progress.\nReturns:\n  Tuple (updated LocalizedScenario, feedback from the localization agent).\n'
CALL_LOCALIZATION_AGENT_GHERKIN_DESC="\nDelegate to the localization agent to begin localization or refine an already localized scenario.\nReceives the localization agent's feedback regarding localization difficulties.\n"
CALL_LOCALIZATION_AGENT_GRAMMATICAL_DESC_OLD='\nDelegate to the Localization agent to refine AtomicBlocks.\nArgs:\n  instructions: Actionable guidance describing what to modify or inspect.\nNotes:\n  The Supervisor automatically injects the current AtomicBlockList from its own state; you must not supply `blocks`.\nUse when:\n  You need the localization agent to re-score candidate methods, adjust bindings, or improve notes for grammatical blocks.\nReturns:\n  Tuple (updated AtomicBlockList, comments).\n'
CALL_LOCALIZATION_AGENT_GRAMMATICAL_DESC="\nDelegate to the localization agent to begin localization or refine an already localized atomic block list.\nReceives the localization agent's feedback regarding localization difficulties.\n"
CALL_COMPOSITION_AGENT_GHERKIN_DESC_OLD='\nDelegate to the composition agent to progress test generation from a localized scenario.\nArgs:\n  instructions: Concrete, informative guidance on test generation and specific implementation details.\nNotes:\n  The Supervisor automatically injects the current LocalizedScenario from its own state; do not supply `blocks`.\nUse when:\n  Generating the code for the test scenario, using the localized test description decomposition.\n  Selecting or revising the test package/class, integrating localized step bindings, adding imports and test annotations, aligning the method body with scenario order, or rewriting code to address diagnostics tied to specific steps.\nReturns:\n  Tuple (updated LocalizedScenario, composition_comments, current_package of generated test|null, current_class of generated test|null).\n'
CALL_COMPOSITION_AGENT_GHERKIN_DESC="\nDelegate to the composition agent to conduct test generation from a localized scenario. \nReceives the composition agent's feedback regarding test composition difficulties from the scenario. \n"
CALL_COMPOSITION_AGENT_GRAMMATICAL_DESC_OLD='\nDelegate to the Composition agent to progress test generation from AtomicBlocks.\nArgs:\n  instructions: Actionable guidance describing the next composition step.\nNotes:\n  The Supervisor automatically injects the latest AtomicBlockList from its state; do not supply `blocks`.\nUse when:\n  Iterating on package/class selection or rewriting test code to match the blocks.\nReturns:\n  Tuple (updated AtomicBlockList, composition_comments, current_package|null, current_class|null).\n'
CALL_COMPOSITION_AGENT_GRAMMATICAL_DESC="\nDelegate to the composition agent to conduct test generation from an atomic block list. \nReceives the composition agent's feedback regarding test composition difficulties from the atomic blocks. \n"
FINALIZE_DESC_OLD='\nEnd supervision when goals are met or iterations are exhausted.\nArgs:\n  None\nUse when:\n  The composed test aligns with the description and scenario and compiles, or when at the iteration limit. This call ends the run.\nReturns:\n  A short acknowledgement string (e.g., selected package/class, compile status, brief notes). Keep this concise.\n'
FINALIZE_DESC='\nEnd supervision once a compilable test satisfies the request.\nProvide 1-2 short sentences in comments; if none, write "No issues.".\n'
