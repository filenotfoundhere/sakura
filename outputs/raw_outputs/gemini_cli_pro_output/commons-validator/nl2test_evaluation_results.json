Begin by instantiating a new `CreditCardValidator` using the no-argument constructor `new CreditCardValidator()` and assign the result to a local variable `ccv` of type `org.apache.commons.validator.routines.CreditCardValidator`. Immediately following this instantiation, invoke the static method `isCreditCard` on `org.apache.commons.validator.GenericValidator`, passing the String literal `\"1234567890\"` as the argument. The test contains no assertions; its purpose is to ensure that the sequence of instantiating `CreditCardValidator` followed by calling `GenericValidator.isCreditCard` does not throw a `NullPointerException`, thereby confirming the circular dependency has been resolved. The test uses no class-level annotations, no setup or teardown methods, and relies solely on JUnit 5 with the `@Test` annotation at the method level.",
