Begin by verifying that when text already surrounded by single quotes is provided, the system removes those outer quotes and returns the clean content.

After establishing basic quote removal, test a more complex scenario where text contains internal single quotes, ensuring the system properly wraps the entire argument in double quotes to preserve the embedded quotation marks. Following this, validate the reverse situation where text includes internal double quotes, verifying the system encases the argument in single quotes to protect the nested double-quoted content. Finally, confirm that when text contains both single and double quotes intermixed, the system recognizes this as an unsupported condition and rejects the input with an appropriate business rule violation, preventing ambiguous quoting scenarios that could lead to incorrect command interpretation.

After establishing this baseline behavior, configure a watchdog with a specific one-minute timeout duration and verify the system correctly applies this custom time limit to the resulting monitor. Next, confirm the system can create a watchdog when the threading mechanism is explicitly left unconfigured, ensuring the component establishes a default threading strategy. Finally, verify that even with an unspecified threading mechanism, the resulting watchdog possesses a valid and operational threading capability, demonstrating the system's ability to provide complete, functional monitoring components regardless of partial configuration.

Begin by confirming that the system can produce a basic monitoring component without any custom settings, verifying the component is created successfully but has no active monitoring mechanism assigned. Next, demonstrate that when the system is configured with missing timeout settings, it still produces a valid component. After establishing this baseline, configure the system with a specific duration limit of one minute and verify the resulting monitoring component correctly reflects this time constraint. Then confirm the system handles missing thread management settings gracefully by producing a valid component. Finally, test a combined configuration scenario where both missing thread management settings and a one-minute duration limit are specified together, ensuring the resulting monitoring component maintains proper thread management capabilities despite the initial missing setting. Throughout these scenarios, verify using standard equality and presence assertions to confirm the system produces valid components and correctly applies configuration values when provided. This validation employs JUnit 5 as the testing framework with AssertJ for assertions.",

After establishing the Mac classification, validate that the system also recognizes its Unix heritage by confirming Unix family membership, then ensure it does not incorrectly report membership in the Windows 9x, general Windows, Windows NT, or z/OS families. This comprehensive verification ensures the platform detection logic maintains accurate family categorization when operating on Mac systems, preventing false positives across incompatible platform types while correctly identifying the dual Mac and Unix nature of the environment.

Next, construct another instance using the same builder pattern and retrieve its internal watchdog component to verify that it returns null when no timeout is configured. Following this, build a third instance by explicitly setting a null timeout on the builder before materialization, confirming that the resulting watchdog is still instantiated despite the null configuration. To validate timeout propagation, construct a builder instance, configure it with a one-minute duration, materialize the watchdog, access its internal watchdog component, retrieve the configured timeout, and assert that it equals the one-minute duration originally provided. Proceed to test thread factory handling by building an instance with an explicitly null thread factory, verifying the watchdog materializes successfully. Finally, chain both configuration methods by setting a null thread factory and a one-minute timeout on the builder, materialize the watchdog, navigate to its internal watchdog component, retrieve the thread factory, and assert that it is not null, demonstrating that null thread factory inputs are replaced with default implementations.

      "description": "Define a test method annotated with `@Test` that validates the builder pattern of `ExecuteWatchdog` through a sequence of six assertion chains. Begin by invoking `ExecuteWatchdog.builder()` to obtain an `ExecuteWatchdog.Builder` instance, immediately chain `.get()` to produce an `ExecuteWatchdog` object, and pass this result to `assertNotNull` to verify the instance is non-null. Next, invoke `ExecuteWatchdog.builder()` again, chain `.get()`, then invoke `getWatchdog()` on the resulting `ExecuteWatchdog` to retrieve the internal `Watchdog` object, and pass this to `assertNull` to confirm it is null when no timeout is configured. For the third assertion, invoke `ExecuteWatchdog.builder()`, chain `.setTimeout(null)` passing the null literal, chain `.get()`, and pass the resulting `ExecuteWatchdog` to `assertNotNull` to verify the instance is created despite the null timeout. For the fourth assertion, create a `Duration` by calling `Duration.ofMinutes(1)`, then invoke `ExecuteWatchdog.builder()`, chain `.setTimeout(Duration.ofMinutes(1))` passing the one-minute duration, chain `.get()` to obtain the `ExecuteWatchdog`, invoke `getWatchdog()` on it to retrieve the `Watchdog`, invoke `getTimeout()` on the `Watchdog` to get the configured timeout duration, and use `assertEquals(Duration.ofMinutes(1), ...)` to verify the timeout equals the expected one-minute duration. For the fifth assertion, invoke `ExecuteWatchdog.builder()`, chain `.setThreadFactory(null)` passing the null literal, chain `.get()`, and pass the resulting `ExecuteWatchdog` to `assertNotNull` to confirm the instance is created with a null thread factory. For the sixth and final assertion, invoke `ExecuteWatchdog.builder()`, chain `.setThreadFactory(null)`, then chain `.setTimeout(Duration.ofMinutes(1))` passing the one-minute duration created via `Duration.ofMinutes(1)`, chain `.get()` to obtain the `ExecuteWatchdog`, invoke `getWatchdog()` to retrieve the `Watchdog`, invoke `getThreadFactory()` on the `Watchdog` to get the configured thread factory, and pass this to `assertNotNull` to verify the thread factory is non-null despite the initial null assignment. The test uses JUnit 5 Assertions with method-level annotation `@Test`.",
